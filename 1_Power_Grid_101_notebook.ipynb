    "    This notebook is an introduction to power system operations and the grid2op pacakge. Operating electrical power grids has been studied for many years around the world and involves many activities. Power grids, especially transmission grids, aim to transport electricity over long distances from power plants to consumers. To be efficient and minimize energy losses, power grids often operate under high voltages (above 20kV). One of the main goals for power grid operators is to ensure a **reliable and secure** continuity of delivery of electricity to consumers under some additional quality criterions that can vary from one country to another.      \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    For simplicity, we show here a small grid made of four substations as well as producers, consumers and powerlines connected to them. However, transmission grids are usually much more complex and involve many long lines that connect different cities or states. A grid often connects an entire country linking hundreds of power plants and distribution networks but our current example should illustrate clearly enough how congestion could arise on the power grid and which operations could help manage it. Congestion management is actually the most critical and time-consuming task for a power grid operator.\n",

    "    A powerline has some physical capacity as illustrated in the figures below. This is the thermal limit of the powerline.\n",
    "    Here is a description of the different cases that can happen :\n",
    "        <img src=\"utils/img/Powerline_ok.png\", width=650, ALIGN=\"middle\", border=20> <b>Best situation :</b> Only a little electricity is flowing through this powerline. It is far from the tree below it, thus presenting very little risk.\n",
    "    <img src=\"utils/img/Powerline_tense.png\", width=650, ALIGN=\"middle\", border=20> <b>Situation at risk :</b> More current flows through the powerline. Due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating\">Joule heating</a>, it gets hotter and closer to the tree below it. Typically, powergrids operators want to be alerted when such a situation becomes critical.\n",
    "    <img src=\"utils/img/Powerline_ko.png\", width=650, ALIGN=\"middle\", border=20> <b>Too late to act</b> Even more current flows through the powerline. Due to Joule heating, it gets even hotter and ends up in contact with the tree. At this point nothing can be done. The tree can catch fire (due to heat), the powerline can break, etc. This situation should be anticipated and avoided.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "    To prevent this potentially dramatic effect, powerlines are often equiped with \"sensors\" that detect when the flow exceeds a certain threshold (called \"<b>thermal limit</b>\"), typically in the second figure above. Then, if the flow remains above this thermal limit for a given amount of time, then the powerline is <b>automatically</b> disconnected form the powergrid without any human intervention to ensure that the last situation exposed previously does not occur. To prevent the disconnection of more and more powerlines (phenomenon called \"cascading failure\") operators often prefer to act <i>before</i> the powerline is disconnected and try to re-route the flow to other powerlines.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    To be as efficient as possible, operators monitor the grid in real time. Knowing the power flowing through all the powerlines of the grid, they can anticipate problems by relying on their expertise and making extensive simulations that require a \"powerflow solver\". That \"powerflow solver\" is able to compute how much power flows in each powerline given the location of productions and consumptions in the grid as well as the topology of the powergrid.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    As a first intuition, power flows increase when the electrical consumption increases. More specifically, the flows in the powerlines are affected by the dynamics of power consumption and the availability of power plants or productions. It often varies along the course of the day, as consumer behaviors change depending on the hour of the day. There are usually more activities in the middle of the day, while lighting is used mostly in the evening. During the night, the electrical consumption is mostly due to electrical heating systems as well as some industries.   \n",
    "<br><br>  \n",
    "    A congestion could be caused by day-to-day demand, but could also be due to some external factors such as changes to the topology of the grid, made by the operator. It could also be caused by lines that are in maintenance or previous faults that led to cascading failures or put the system in unstable conditions.\n",

    "    In this notebook, we reviewed very quickly the main principles of operating transmission networks with a small grid. The continuity of the electric power service is crucial for the current economy and should be robust enough so that hazards or exceptional situations do not stop it from delivering electricity. An undesired line disconnection, if not followed by an action that could solve the problem, might cause blackouts and economic losses. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    As we mentioned earlier, transmission grids operation involves many tasks but all of them are designed to reach one single objective: to supply reliable and secure electricity. Operators work every day to minimize the impact of external factors that put the electrical system at risk, but eventually when the grid is large and meshed, the daily operation is more complicated.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    The Grid2Op platform was designed to interact with reinforcement learning approaches. It allows executing actions in the transmission grid, to manage congestions or attempt to solve any problem that might occur, and is able to compute and return the resulting state of the environment. We covered actions such as line disconnections and nodes splitting, but there are many other complex combinations of those that a user could try.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "    The goal for this challenge is to train an agent that will be able to learn a policy that could overcome obstacles, such as congestions, while optimizing the overall cost. It should be crucial that the agent learns a notion of robustness so that the electricity can be delivered reliably and securely, while getting closer to the operational constraints of the grid to make the task of operating the grid less expensive.\n",
