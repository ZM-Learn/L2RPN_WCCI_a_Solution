class AgentWithConverter(BaseAgent):
    """
    Compared to a regular BaseAgent, these types of Agents are able to deal with a different representation of
    :class:`grid2op.Action.BaseAction` and :class:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation`.

    As any other Agents, AgentWithConverter will implement the :func:`BaseAgent.act` method. But for them, it's slightly
    different.

    They receive in this method an observation, as an object (ie an instance of
    :class:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation`). This
    object can then be converted to any other object with the method :func:`AgentWithConverter.convert_obs`.

    Then, this `transformed_observation` is pass to the method :func:`AgentWithConverter.my_act` that is supposed
    to be defined for each agents. This function outputs an `encoded_act` which can be whatever you want to be.

    Finally, the `encoded_act` is decoded into a proper action, object of class :class:`grid2op.Action.BaseAction`,
    thanks to the method :func:`AgentWithConverter.convert_act`.

    This allows, for example, to represent actions as integers to train more easily standard discrete control algorithm
    used to solve atari games for example.

    **NB** It is possible to define :func:`AgentWithConverter.convert_obs` and :func:`AgentWithConverter.convert_act`
     or to define a :class:`grid2op.Converters.Converter` and feed it to the `action_space_converter` parameters
     used to initialise the class. The second option is preferred, as the :attr:`AgentWithConverter.action_space`
     will then directly be this converter. Such an BaseAgent will really behave as if the actions are encoded the way he
     wants.

    Examples
    --------
    For example, imagine an BaseAgent uses a neural networks to take its decision.

    Suppose also that, after some
    features engineering, it's best for the neural network to use only the load active values
    (:attr:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation.load_p`) and the sum of the
    relative flows (:attr:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation.rho`) with the active flow
    (:attr:`grid2op.Observation.BaseObservation.p_or`) [**NB** that agent would not make sense a priori, but who knows]

    Suppose that this neural network can be accessed with a class `AwesomeNN` (not available...) that can
    predict some actions. It can be loaded with the "load" method and make predictions with the
    "predict" method.

    For the sake of the examples, we will suppose that this agent only predicts powerline status (so 0 or 1) that
    are represented as vector. So we need to take extra care to convert this vector from a numpy array to a valid
    action.

    This is done below:


    .. code-block:: python

        import grid2op
        import AwesomeNN # this does not exists!
        # create a simple environment
        env = grid2op.make()

        # define the class above
        class AgentCustomObservation(AgentWithConverter):
            def __init__(self, action_space, path):
                AgentWithConverter.__init__(self, action_space)
                self.my_neural_network = AwesomeNN()
                self.my_neural_networl.load(path)

            def convert_obs(self, observation):
                # convert the observation
                return np.concatenate((observation.load_p, observation.rho + observation.p_or))

            def convert_act(self, encoded_act):
                # convert back the action, output from the NN "self.my_neural_network"
                # to a valid action
                act = self.action_space({"set_status": encoded_act})

            def my_act(self, transformed_observation, reward, done=False):
                act_predicted = self.my_neural_network(transformed_observation)
                return act_predicted


        # make the agent that behaves as expected.
        my_agent = AgentCustomObservation(action_space=env.action_space, path=".")

        # this agent is perfectly working :-) You can use it as any other agents.

        the action space is directly encoded the way it wants.
