from grid2op.Agent.BaseAgent import BaseAgent


class OneChangeThenNothing(BaseAgent):
    """
    This is a specific kind of BaseAgent. It does an BaseAction (possibly non empty) at the first time step and then does
    nothing.

    This class is an abstract class and cannot be instanciated (ie no object of this class can be created). It must
    be overridden and the method :func:`OneChangeThenNothing._get_dict_act` be defined. Basically, it must know
    what action to do.

    Attributes
    ------------
    my_dict: ``dict`` (class member)
        Representation, as a dictionnary of the only action that this Agent will do at the first time step.

    Examples
    ---------

    We advise to use this class as following

    .. code-block:: python


        import grid2op
        from grid2op.Agent import OneChangeThenNothing
        acts_dict_ = [{}, {"set_line_status": [(0,-1)]}]  # list of dictionnaries. Each dictionnaries representing a valid action

        env = grid2op.make()  # create an environment
        for act_as_dict in zip(acts_dict_):
            # generate the proper class that will perform the first action (encoded by {}) in acts_dict_
            agent_class = OneChangeThenNothing.gen_next(act_as_dict)

            # start a runner with this agent
            runner = Runner(**env.get_params_for_runner(), agentClass=agent_class)
            # run 2 episode with it
            res_2 = runner.run(nb_episode=2)
