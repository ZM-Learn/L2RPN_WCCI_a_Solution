All you have to do to make a submission is create or modify the `make_agent` and `reward` variables in the `submission.py` script as seen earlier, then make sure that everything works fine with the following test script. This is the actual program that will run on the server to test your submission. <br>\n",

    "For example, as we mentioned, the starting dates / times are very different in the hidden dataset compared to the provided dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the hidden dataset on which your agent will be evaluated has been carefully picked so as to offer different levels of difficulty, but the provided training dataset has NOT. For that reason, the scores will likely not be similar, even though these two datasets originate from the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, on codalab, your agent might timeout if it takes too much time to run. However, for this sandbox competition, only small care has been taken about the execution time so this is not a very restrictive constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next two cells will test that everything is working correctly and that the submission can be sent. That process will run the agent on a small portion of the training dataset. **It will also generate the zip file that you will have to upload to Codalab.**"
